ToolBooth

Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay 50 Rupees toll. Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying. The tollbooth keeps track of the number of cars that have gone by, and of the total amount of money collected.

Model this tollbooth with a class called TollBooth. The two data items are to hold the total number of cars as private, and to hold the total amount of money collected as private

A way initializes both of these to 0.

A member function called payingar() increments the car total and adds 50/- to the cash total.

Another function, called nopayCar(), increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total.

Finally, a member function called display() displays the two totals.

Make appropriate member functions, make all the member variables as private and define the required property procedures.

create a function and pass n values to the function for testing the above logic c.g.

sample('p', 'p', 'n', 'p', 'n')

sample('p', 'p', 'n', 'p', 'p' ,'n', 'p')

sample('p', 'p', 'n', 'p', n', 'p' ,'p' , 'p' ,'n')

to test the logic for each input passed to the function.
